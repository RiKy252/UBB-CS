sigma = variance
mean = average

test.pdf file:
1. 
ztest => test for mean when sigma is known (variance)
ttest => test for mean when sigma is unknown

2.
n = length(data);
s2 = var(data, 1);  % Sample variance
sigma0_squared = 10;  % Hypothesized variance
chi2_stat = (n - 1) * s2 / sigma0_squared;
p_value = 1 - chi2cdf(chi2_stat, n - 1);  % Right-tailed p-value
p_value = chi2cdf(chi2_stat, n - 1); % Left-tailed p-value

3.
ttest2 => ttest for 2 sets of data for mean

4.
vartest2 => comparing the variances of two independent samples (check if they are equal or different)
