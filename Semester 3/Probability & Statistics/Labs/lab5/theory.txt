mean = average
x = vector of data
x bar = average / mean of the data
n = number of elements in x
v bar = population standard deviation
z index(1 - alpha / 2) = quantile of order 1 - alpha / 2 of the law N(0, 1).
s = sample standard deviation -> std(x)

for A.
x is not matrix
it has values on first line
freq on the second
so x should look like:
x = [20, 20, 21, 22, 22, 22, ...]

for 2.
 (approximately) normally distributed -> normal underlying populations
so we can use the 3. in conf_int in a) b)
4. for c)
